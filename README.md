# Hyperion - App Inspection Tool

## What is it?

Hyperion is a hidden plugin drawer that can easily be integrated into any app. The drawer sits discreetly ðŸ™Š under the app so that it is there when you need it and out of the way when you don't. Hyperion plugins are designed to make inspection of your app quick and simple.

Please see our announcement [blog post](https://willowtreeapps.com/ideas/introducing-hyperion-for-android) for a feature showcase.

## Third-Party Plugins

Be one of the first to create a third-party plugin. The plugin creation guide is a work in progress, but if you are feeling ambitious you can reference the plugins we have already created.

To create your own plugin, implement the Plugin interface and expose the implementation as a service. The plugins made available in this repository leverage Google's [AutoService](https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/service) annotation processor to generate the service metadata and simplify the process.

## How To Show Hyperion Plugin List

Once Hyperion is integrated into your app, simply shake your phone to activate. If you are running your app on an emulator, you can manually open the menu by calling `Hyperion.open(Activity activity)`. You can also open the menu by selecting the foreground notification that appears while the client app is in the foreground.

### Conditional Startup

Hyperion enables itself automatically for all Activities in your application. To disable for specific Activities, annotate them with `@HyperionIgnore`. To disable for all Activities, set a `meta-data` field in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
    <meta-data
        android:name="com.willowtreeapps.hyperion.core.enableOnStart"
        android:value="false"/>
```

`Hyperion#open(Activity)` will have no affect if Hyperion has not been enabled. You can reenable for future Activities with `Hyperion.enable()`.

To embed the Hyperion Plugin Menu into your own Activity, acquire a `PluginViewFactory` from `Hyperion#getPluginViewFactory` and call `create(Activity)`:

```Java
View pluginView = Hyperion.getPluginViewFactory().create(activity);
```

See [FactoryActivity](hyperion-sample/src/main/java/com/willowtreeapps/hyperion/sample/FactoryActivity.java) for more details.

## Sample App

Want to learn how to use Hyperion? The sample app will teach you!

Build the example project by cloning the repo, run `./gradlew assemble` from the root directory, then open in Android Studio and run.

## Requirements

min SDK 15

### Download

--------

Download via Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.willowtreeapps.hyperion</groupId>
  <artifactId>hyperion-core</artifactId>
  <version>0.9.34</version>
</dependency>
```

or Gradle:

```groovy
debugImplementation 'com.willowtreeapps.hyperion:hyperion-core:0.9.34'
```

If you reference Hyperion from your code, you should also compile the no-op artifact for release variants. For most users, this will not be necessary:

```groovy
releaseImplementation 'com.willowtreeapps.hyperion:hyperion-core-no-op:0.9.34'
```

### Usage

--------

Include the core library along with any number of plugins.

```groovy
debugImplementation 'com.willowtreeapps.hyperion:hyperion-core:0.9.34'
debugImplementation 'com.willowtreeapps.hyperion:hyperion-attr:0.9.34'
debugImplementation 'com.willowtreeapps.hyperion:hyperion-build-config:0.9.34'
debugImplementation 'com.willowtreeapps.hyperion:hyperion-crash:0.9.34'
debugImplementation 'com.willowtreeapps.hyperion:hyperion-disk:0.9.34'
debugImplementation 'com.willowtreeapps.hyperion:hyperion-geiger-counter:0.9.34'
debugImplementation 'com.willowtreeapps.hyperion:hyperion-measurement:0.9.34'
debugImplementation 'com.willowtreeapps.hyperion:hyperion-phoenix:0.9.34'
debugImplementation 'com.willowtreeapps.hyperion:hyperion-recorder:0.9.34'
debugImplementation 'com.willowtreeapps.hyperion:hyperion-shared-preferences:0.9.34'
debugImplementation 'com.willowtreeapps.hyperion:hyperion-timber:0.9.34'
```

## Adding Plugins

Hyperion plugins need to be added into the app at build time.
By default, Hyperion automatically finds every plugin that is available in the project using the Java Service Locator.
